I have developed an AI Code Reviewer which main objective is to develop a Python application that allows users to submit their Python code for review and receive feedback on potential bugs along with suggestions for fixes. The application should be user-friendly, efficient, and provide accurate bug reports and fixed code snippets.
It is using Streamlit as an interface and OpenAI library for reviewing the code functionality using the concepts of Prompt Engineering.
Executed the development of the GenAI App - AI Code Reviewer, a Python application aimed at providing users with comprehensive feedback on their Python code submissions.
- Designed and implemented a streamlined user interface using Streamlit, ensuring ease of use and seamless interaction for users.
- Developed an efficient and accurate system leveraging the OpenAI API to incorporate advanced code review functionality, enabling automated analysis of submitted code for potential bugs and errors.
